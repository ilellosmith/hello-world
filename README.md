# hello-world

I am a recent graduate from Cornell University interested in applying computational geography and data science tools to inform urban sustainability efforts, improve public health outcomes, and reduce social inequity. I believe that data-driven, equity-focused policies and initiatives can lead the way towards more just, healthy, and resilient cities. 

In my free time I enjoy cooking, ultimate frisbee, biking, rock climbing and reading!
